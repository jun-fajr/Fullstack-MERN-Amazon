# Fullstack-MERN-Amazon

In this project I will create a full stack Amazon Clone with Next.js 13 App Router, Reactjs, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Node.js, Typescript, and Zustand. I will be using Amplication for the backend.

Amplication automatically generates backend services with the highest standards, consistency, and scalability. Accelerate your development 20X. Save time on boilerplate and repetitive coding again.
